# OpenLogsLauz
Unleash the power of AI and let it cook (foundue, if possible) to brew the answers to all of your questions.

This is a project made in LauzHack 2023 at EPFL, Lausane, Switzerland

## Inspiration
We realized that most of our daily programming issues can be identified by looking carefully at the logs. But what a better way to automatize this boring and tedious task. 

## What it does
We have built a Telegram chatbot that lets you upload the log file you want to analyze and what would you like to know about it. It will return the answer to your question. A good example is: 

\*Uploads the log file\*

IN: ` Did the user 'jonny' remove any prrogram in his computer?`

OUT: ` Yes! The user jonny deleted the 'google-chrome-stable' on Nov 27 at 23:57:23`



## How we built
We splited the project into two main parts: the gptCore stuff, and the Telegram API, both programmed in Python3
